In order to start writing JavaScript code, you need to set up a development environment on your computer. This lesson will guide you through the process of setting up a basic development environment for JavaScript programming.

**Step 1: Install a Text Editor**

The first step in setting up a development environment is to install a text editor. A text editor is a software application that allows you to create and edit text files. There are many text editors available, but some popular options for JavaScript programming include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Choose the one that you prefer and download and install it on your computer.

**Step 2: Install Node.js**

The next step is to install Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, which is useful for building server-side applications or scripts. You can download the Node.js installer from the official website and install it on your computer.

**Step 3: Create a Project Folder**

Create a new folder on your computer for your JavaScript project. This folder will contain all of the files for your project, including your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Give your project folder a name that reflects the purpose of your project.

**Step 4: Create a HTML File**

Create a new file in your project folder and name it index.html. Open this file in your text editor and add some basic HTML code to create a web page. This will be the starting point for your JavaScript project.

**Step 5: Create a JavaScript File**

Create a new file in your project folder and name it app.js. This file will contain your JavaScript code. Open this file in your text editor and add some basic JavaScript code to test that your development environment is working correctly. For example, you could add the following code:

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

**Step 6: Link Your JavaScript File to Your HTML File**

To make your JavaScript code work with your HTML file, you need to link the two files together. Open your index.html file in your text editor and add a script tag to the head section of your HTML file. This script tag should reference your app.js file. For example:

```html
<head>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Step 7: Test Your Development Environment**

Open your index.html file in a web browser and open the developer console. You should see "Hello World!" printed in the console, which confirms that your development environment is set up correctly.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a basic development environment for JavaScript programming. You can now start writing and testing your JavaScript code in your project folder.
